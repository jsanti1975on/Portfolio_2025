# Jason Santiago — Cybersecurity & Network Engineering

Hands-on projects in network automation, security operations, and ethical hacking.  

> *Been labbing since they were called experiments — this portfolio captures the grind, the curiosity, and the results.*

> Currently taking: **CET 2892C – Ethical Hacking (Fall 2025)**

*Every problem in life is simple once it has been figured out*

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 1) Cyber-Range (Home Lab)
- Dual-ISP range, VLANs, pfSense, ESXi hosts, Pi-hole DNS sinkhole, AD/DNS/PKI, and segmented “East/West” networks.
- Artifacts: network diagrams, pfSense rulesets, VLAN configs, and incident drill runbooks.
- **Focus:** threat emulation, detection visibility, and change control notes.  
[`projects/Cyber_Range`](projects/Cyber_Range/)

### 2) Ethical Hacking Labs (CET 2892C)
- Web vulns, auth bypasses, upload abuse, and Windows/Linux privilege escalation.
- Deliverables: reproducible lab write-ups (steps → evidence → mitigation).
[`projects/EthicalHackingCET2892C_15850`](projects/EthicalHackingCET2892C_15850/)

### 3) Linux Enterprise / Red Hat Track
- Service hardening, SELinux basics, user & auth policy, automation.

## 🎓 Coursework — Final 4 Classes

- [ ] **CNT 2414C** – Cybercrime Investigation  
- [ ] **CET 2890C** – Advanced Cybersecurity Operations  
- [x] **CET 2892C** – Ethical Hacking *(In Progress — Fall 2025)*  
- [ ] **CET 2894C** – Projects in Cyber Security: **Capstone**  

### 4) Capstone — Projects in Cyber Security (CET 2894C)
- **Credits:** 3 (2 lab hours)  
- **Prereqs:** CET 2890C (Advanced Cybersecurity Operations), CET 2892C (Ethical Hacking)  
- **Objective:** Apply and integrate the full Cybersecurity track into a live defensive exercise.

**Planned Deliverables**
- Inventory & assessment of a live network environment
- Hardening of endpoints, servers, and network services
- Monitoring & detection with log analysis, sinkhole/DNS, and pfSense/IDS integrations
- Red-team injects: exploit → detection → incident response
- Blue-team actions: incident handling, containment, reporting
- **Cyber Defense Competition prep** (regional/national style format)

**Artifacts for Repo**
