# ✅ `server_corrected.py` Change Log

This document outlines the changes made to the `server.py` file in the **East Side IoT Server** project. These updates improve functionality, security, logging, and static resource handling.

---

## 🔐 1. Logging Enhancements

- **Console Logging** (`StreamHandler`) retained.
- ✅ **File Logging** added:
  - Logs written to `eastside.log`.
  - Uses a consistent formatter for both handlers.

```python
file_handler = logging.FileHandler('eastside.log')
file_handler.setFormatter(formatter)
logger.addHandler(file_handler)
```

---

## 🧰 2. Secure File Upload Handling

- Validates `Content-Type` for boundary string.
- ✅ Sanitizes filenames using regex:
  - Removes harmful characters.
  - Blocks path traversal (`..`, `/`) using fallback filename: `fake_passwd`.

- **Bot Trap**:
  - Fake `/etc/passwd` returned when `fake_passwd` is detected in uploads.

---

## 📂 3. File Routing by Prefix

Uploaded files are routed to folders based on their prefixes:

| Prefix       | Routed To         |
|--------------|-------------------|
| `orchid_`    | `orchids/`        |
| `doc_`       | `docs/`           |
| `after_`     | `after-work/`     |
| `assign_`    | `assignments/`    |
| *(default)*  | `assignments/`    |

```python
if filename.startswith('orchid_'):
    self.move_orchid_files(filepath)
...
```

---

## ✅ 4. HTML Success Page for Uploads

- Displays uploaded filename.
- Shows confirmation message and `success.png`.
- Redirect button to `/upload`.

---

## 🌐 5. Static Resource Serving

### ✔️ `/success.png` endpoint:
- Serves PNG image or 404 fallback with user-friendly message.

### ✔️ `/images/` handler:
- Dynamically serves images stored in the `images/` folder.

---

## 🔄 6. RSS Feed Integration

### `/fetch_rss`:
- Returns latest 5 articles from [SecurityWeek](https://www.securityweek.com/feed/) as JSON.
- Handles errors gracefully.

---

## 🛠️ 7. Structural & Error Handling Fixes

- Fixed a broken `elif` block for `/images/` that was outside any method.
- Improved multipart and header parsing logic.
- Added debug logging for multipart errors and malformed headers.
