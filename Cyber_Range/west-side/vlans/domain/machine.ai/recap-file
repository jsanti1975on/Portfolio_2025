# Build AvA – Cyber Awareness Range

## 📌 Project Overview
Build AvA is a cyber range and awareness training environment.  
It integrates Windows Server labs, simulated phishing/awareness demos, and infrastructure monitoring.

This project is tied directly to the **Machine.AI Windows Server Portfolio (CET2793)**.  
That portfolio documents AD DS, DHCP, OU structures, and server configurations which serve as the backbone for AvA.

## 🖥️ Hardware Platform
Running on a **Dell PowerEdge R730 (Renewed)**:
- 2 × Intel Xeon E5-2678 v3 (24 cores total)
- 64 GB RAM
- Dell H330 RAID Controller
- 4 × 600 GB SAS drives

## 📂 Project Components
- **Portfolio Docs**: Windows Server 2019/AD DS environment setup  
- **Awareness Demo**: PDF + XLSM (macro awareness training)  
- **Infrastructure**: Domain controllers, DHCP, shared folders, quotas  
- **Clients**: Windows 10 endpoints for testing and awareness training  

---

## 🔑 Current Status
- ✅ Server builds completed  
- ✅ AD DS + OU structure tested  
- ✅ DHCP + client integration validated  
- ⚠️ GPO documentation incomplete  
- ⚠️ Awareness demo files need integration into email workflow

## 🚧 Next Steps
- Expand **GPO policies** and document results  
- Deploy **Awareness Demo Package** inside HR simulation  
- Benchmark the Dell PowerEdge R730 performance under load  
- Integrate AvA into larger **Cyber Range projects**
