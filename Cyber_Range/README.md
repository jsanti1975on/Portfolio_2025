# Cyber Range Project Summary: HTTP File Server & Dashboard

## Project Overview:

```PlainText
This project simulates a secure file server interface within a cyber range environment. It includes an advanced HTML dashboard and a custom Python-based HTTP server, designed to accept, categorize, and safely store uploaded files while displaying live cybersecurity news via RSS.
```

## Frontend (HTML Dashboard)

**Title**: Advanced Cyber Security | Fall Dashboard

**Features**:

- Grid-style panels for various modules: RHEL, Cisco, Windows Server, CompTIA Security+, TryHackMe.
- Upload panel with file submission and a button to view uploaded files.
- TryHackMe badge and public profile embedded using iframe.
- RSS feed box that fetches and displays cybersecurity headlines from SecurityWeek.
- Hover-triggered image previews for each panel for enhanced visual feedback.

## üõ†Ô∏è Backend (Python HTTP Server)

**Framework**: `http.server.SimpleHTTPRequestHandler` (custom subclass)

**Functions**:

- **POST**:
  - Parses multipart form data.
  - Sanitizes file names to prevent path traversal or shell injection.
  - Detects and redirects a dummy `fake_passwd` input for security testing.
  - Moves uploaded files into categorized folders by filename pattern or extension:
    - `scripts_*.sh` ‚ûù `/scripts/`
    - `cyberoperations_*` ‚ûù `/CyberOperations/`
    - `vSphere_*` ‚ûù `/vSphere/`
    - Audio files (`.mp3`, `.wav`) ‚ûù `/Music-files/`

- **GET**:
  - Serves static content and handles:
    - `/success.png` image fetch for confirmation visuals.
    - `/fetch_rss` API for client-side RSS feed loading via `fetch`.

- **Logging**:
  - Uses Python's `logging` module to track operations, errors, and debug issues.

## üìÇ Folder Structure Created on Upload

- `/uploads/` ‚Äì Temporary file staging.
- `/scripts/` ‚Äì For shell or automation scripts.
- `/CyberOperations/` ‚Äì Red vs Blue operational files.
- `/vSphere/` ‚Äì VMware-related configurations or exports.
- `/Music-files/` ‚Äì Audio content (.mp3, .wav).

---

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

- Add authentication for upload page access.
- Integrate with a backend database for file tracking.
- Dockerize the environment for easy deployment in test ranges.
- Include virus scanning (e.g., ClamAV) for uploaded files.
